Struct::Flatten::Template - flatten data structures using a template

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Struct::Flatten::Template;

  my $tpl = {
    docs => [
      {
         key => \ { column => 0 },
         sum => {
            value => \ { column => 1 },
      }
    ],
  };

  my @data = ( );

  my $hnd = sub {
    my ($obj, $val, $args) = @_;

    my $idx = $args->{_index};
    my $col = $args->{column};

    $data[$idx] ||= [ ];
    $data[$idx]->[$col] = $val;
  };

  my $data = {
    docs => [
      { key => 'A', sum => { value => 10 } },
      { key => 'B', sum => { value =>  4 } },
      { key => 'C', sum => { value => 18 } },
    ],
  };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is used for "flattening" complex, deeply-nested data
structures, such as those returned by an ElasticSearch aggregation
query.

It is configured with a L</template> that mirrors the data structure,
where some parts of the template contain information how to process
the corresponding parts of the data structure.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<template>

This is a template of the data structure.

This is basically a copy of the data structure, with the hash
reference keys and values that you care to extract information from,
using the L</handler>.

To obtain a value, set it to a reference to a hash reference, e.g.

  key => \ { ... }

The keys in the hash reference can be whatever youre application
needs, so long as they are not prefixed with an underscore.

The following special keys are used:

=over

=item C<_index>

This is either the array index of hash key or array item that the
value is associated with.

=item C<_sort>

If set, this is a method used to sort hash keys, when the template
refers to a list of hash keys, e.g.

  key => \ {
             _sort => sub { $_[0] cmp $_[1] },
             ...
           }

=item C<_next>

If your template is for hash keys instead of values, then this refers
to the value of that hash key in the template.

It is useful if you want to have your handler fill-in intermediate
values (e.g. gaps in a list of dates) by calling the L</process>
method.

=back

Note: to trigger a callback on hash keys instead of values, use
L<Tie::RefHash>.

Also note that templates for array references assume the first element
applies to all elements of the data structure being processed.

=cut

has 'template' => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => 'Ref',
    required => 1,
);

=head2 C<is_testing>

This is true if the template is being processed using L</test>.

This is useful to extract meta-information from your template,
e.g. field titles.

It is intended to be used from within the L</handler>.

=cut

has 'is_testing' => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => 'Bool',
    default  => 0,
    init_arg => undef,
    writer   => '_set_is_testing',
);

=head2 C<ignore_missing>

If true, missing substructures will be ignored and the template will
be processed.  This is useful for setting default values for missing
parts of the structure.

This is false by default.

=cut

has 'ignore_missing' => (
    is      => 'rw',
    isa     => 'Bool',
    default => 1,
);

=head2 C<handler>

The handler is a reference to a function, e.g.

  sub {
    my ($obj, $value, $args) = @_;

    if ($obj->is_testing) {
      ...
    } else {
      ...
    }
  }

where C<$obj> is the C<Struct::Flatten::Template> object, C<$value> is
the value from the data structure being processed, and C<$args> is a
hash reference from the template.

Note that C<$args> may have additional keys added to it. See L</template>.

Your handler will need to use the information in C<$args> to determine
what to do with the data, e.g., where in a spreadsheet or what column
in a database to it.

=cut

has 'handler' => (
    is     => 'ro',
    isa    => 'Maybe[CodeRef]',
    reader => '_get_handler',
    writer => '_set_handler',
);

around '_get_handler' => sub {
    my ( $orig, $self, $template ) = @_;

    my $type = ref $template;
    return unless $type;

    if ( ( $type eq 'REF' ) && ( ref( ${$template} ) eq 'HASH' ) ) {
        return $self->$orig;
    } else {
        return;
    }
};

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<run>

  $obj->run( $struct );

Process C<$struct> using the L</template>.

=cut

sub run {
    my ( $self, $struct ) = @_;
    $self->_set_is_testing(0);
    $self->process($struct);
}

=head2 C<test>

  $obj->test();

Test the template. Essentially, it processes the L</template> against
itself.

=cut

sub test {
    my ( $self, $struct ) = @_;
    $self->_set_is_testing(1);
    $self->process( $self->template );
}

=head2 C<process>

=head2 C<process_HASH>

=head2 C<process_ARRAY>

  $obj->process($struct, $template, $index);

These are low-level methods for processing the template. In general,
you don't need to worry about them unless you are subclassing this.

If you are inserting intermediate values from within your handler,
you should be calling the C<process> method.

=cut

    my ( $self, @args ) = @_;
